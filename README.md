## The 4 p.m. problem

It's 4 p.m. Claude Code says **"usage limit reached — resets at 10 p.m."** You're three hours into a session: architecture decided, edge cases mapped, half the diff written.

❌ **Without baton** — open another agent and start from zero. Re-explain the plan. Re-read the files. Re-litigate every decision you already made.

✅ **With baton** — pass the session and keep going:

```sh
baton convert --from claude-code --to opencode --latest --import
# using latest claude-code session: 2026-07-09 15:58  Refactor the auth middleware to…
# passed baton: claude-code → opencode (1388 messages) → handoff.json
# Imported session: ses_8c4c973a521549e2

opencode -s ses_8c4c973a521549e2   # same conversation, different runner
```

Works in every direction: switch agents mid-task, try a second opinion on a hard bug, move a session from your editor agent to a terminal agent, or archive everything in one format.

## Quick start

```sh
# zero-install run (downloads prebuilt binary)
npx @kasabeh/baton-mcp --help

# convert your most recent session + auto-import into the target agent
baton convert --from claude-code --to opencode --latest --import

# or omit the path to pick interactively — newest first,
# each session previewed by its first user message
baton convert --from claude-code --to opencode --import

# or pass an explicit session file
baton convert --from claude-code --to opencode <session.jsonl> --import

# see every session on your machine, across all agents
baton list
```

### Where do session files live?

You never have to hunt these down (`--latest` and the interactive picker find them for you), but for reference — each agent stores its transcripts on disk:

| Agent | Location |
|---|---|
| Claude Code | `~/.claude/projects/<encoded-cwd>/<session-uuid>.jsonl` |
| Codex CLI | `~/.codex/sessions/<YYYY>/<MM>/<DD>/rollout-*.jsonl` |

`baton list` prints the path of every session it can find, across all agents.

## Supported formats

| Agent | Read | Write | Auto-import |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Claude Code | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ `--import` (also registers in macOS Desktop when present) |
| OpenCode | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ `opencode import` |
| Codex CLI | ✅ | ✅ | — |
| Gemini CLI | ✅ | ✅ | — |
| Zed | ✅ | ✅ | — |
| Aider | ✅ | ✅ | — |
| Cursor | ✅¹ | —² | — |
| Continue | ✅ | — | — |
| Cline / Roo Code / Kilo Code / Zoo Code | ✅³ | —² | — |

¹ Cursor reads from exported JSON (`sqlite3 state.vscdb "SELECT value FROM ItemTable WHERE key='aiService:chats'"`)

² Not planned: Cursor and Cline keep session state inside editor databases (SQLite / VS Code globalState) with no file-level import path.

³ Pass the task directory (`<globalStorage>/<extension-id>/tasks/<task-id>/`) or the `api_conversation_history.json` in it. Workspace, title, timestamps, models, images, subtasks (as opencode child sessions) and condensed-context summaries (as opencode compactions) come along; tools map to opencode's native ones where one exists.

### Claude Desktop's Code tab (macOS)

Claude Code imports automatically register in Desktop as well as the CLI on macOS:

```sh
# Run from the project directory where you will continue the session.
baton convert --from opencode --to claude-code session.json --import
```

Sign in to Claude Desktop first, then fully quit and restart it after importing.
Desktop loads these registrations at startup and displays only the active
account/organization's sessions. Baton registers in **every existing** UUID
account/organization directory under
`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude-code-sessions/`, including empty
directories and those containing only scheduled tasks. It does not create accounts.
If Desktop has no account/organization directories, the CLI import still succeeds.
The MCP `import_to_target` tool uses the same automatic registration behavior.

Each new `local_<uuid>.json` links to the imported CLI transcript in
`~/.claude/projects/<encoded-cwd>/<cliSessionId>.jsonl`. Registrations use mode
0600 and never replace existing entries. Baton neither reads existing Desktop
session files nor copies their MCP, bridge, permission, or prompt state. New
registrations use the default model and permissions, high effort, browser
permission mode `ask`, and no inherited tool approvals. Desktop's completed-turn
counter starts at zero.

This integration uses the on-disk schema observed in Claude Desktop
2.9939.2, not an official import API. Windows paths and other Desktop versions
are not verified. A repeated import creates a fresh Desktop registration; it does
not deduplicate existing Desktop sessions. Conversion without importing does not
register anything. On other operating systems, imports remain CLI-only.
If a registration write fails after the CLI import, its transcript
and any successfully registered scopes remain available. Fixture tests verify the
registration files and CLI links, not the Desktop application's rendering.

## Benchmark

Does carrying the full transcript beat writing a handoff summary for the next agent? We measured both on a real 3.4 MB Claude Code session (same model both arms, only the context differs):

| session size | baton transcript | handoff summary |
|---|---:|---:|
| sm (93 KB) | **3/3** details recalled | 1/3 |
| md (198 KB) | **6/6** | 1/6 |
| lg (599 KB) | **5/8** | 1/8 |
| **total** | **14/17** | **3/17** |

The summary lost concrete facts (versions, line counts, MSRV) even on the smallest slice — the receiving agent had to re-read files and re-run commands to rediscover them. Mechanical fidelity: all 896 messages are written to every target; round-trip loss reflects each target format's expressiveness (claude-code 896/896, codex 736, gemini-cli 723, aider 111 — it stores chat text only).

We also measured **task continuation**: cut the session at three mid-task points, ask a fresh agent to state the task, state, and next steps. Result: parity (baton 10/12, handoff 10/12) — a good summary is enough for *what to do next*; the transcript is what answers the *specific factual questions* the summary's author didn't anticipate. And the summary only exists if an agent spends a full transcript read writing it — baton makes the transfer free.

Full methodology, caveats, and reproduction steps: [benchmark/RESULTS.md](benchmark/RESULTS.md).

## MCP server

baton is also an MCP server — your agent can pass the baton itself, mid-conversation:

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| `list_sessions` | Scan all agents, return a unified list |
| `convert_session` | Convert a session from one format to another |
| `import_to_target` | Convert + run the target agent's import command |
| `detect_format` | Sniff a file/dir and report which agent produced it |

```sh
baton install     # registers baton in every detected agent's MCP config
baton doctor      # verify
baton uninstall   # remove from all agents
```

## How it works

```
Claude Code session (.jsonl)
      │
      ▼
  baton read ──► canonical Session { messages: [Text, Reasoning, ToolCall, ToolResult] }
      │
      ▼
  baton write ──► OpenCode import JSON (SessionV1 schema)
```

Every agent format is read into a **canonical intermediate representation**, then written out in the target format. Adding a new format is O(1), not O(N×M) per-pair converters.

```

## Contributing

Each format lives in `src/formats/<name>.rs` and implements the `Format` trait (read + write). See `src/formats/claude_code.rs` for a complete reference implementation.

All nine formats have readers; Claude Code, OpenCode, Codex, Zed, Aider, and Gemini CLI also have writers. The most impactful contribution now is a **writer** for Continue.

### Regenerating the demo

The README GIF is scripted with [VHS](https://github.com/charmbracelet/vhs): `vhs assets/demo.tape`. It records against a sandboxed `$HOME` (`/tmp/demo`) populated with fabricated sessions, so no real session data ends up in the GIF.

Don't drop the baton.
